description: 'The Agilent Genomics NextGen Toolkit (AGeNT) is a Java-based software module that processes the read sequences from targeted high-throughput sequencing data generated by sequencing Agilent SureSelect and HaloPlex libraries. AGeNT trims low quality bases from the ends, removes adaptor sequences, and masks enzyme footprints (for HaloPlex). Properly curating read sequences prior to alignment improves alignment efficiency and decreases the rate of false positive variant calls. AGeNT also processes the Molecular Barcode (MBC) information in HaloPlexHS and SureSelect XT HS Illumina data, where it tags read pairs in a BAM/SAM file with their MBC sequences read out of the index 2 FASTQ file(s), and mark or remove MBC duplicates from that BAM/SAM file.'
